# 🏹 Shilu
Shilu is a Minecraft PVP Client project made using [Mixin](https://github.com/SpongePowered/Mixin). This client is far from
being perfect and it contains a lot of bugs. This is more of an experiment with Mixins rather a serious project, as I'm missing
motivation and interest to keep this project alive.
